        You can set up visual studio by downloading the Visual Studio IDE software you want to program on Visual studio. You will then connect a folder to Visual studio. If you have not installed Live-Server extension then do that now. After that, you can finally create programs but you always need to remember to put a folder in your Visual studio folder and open it from Visual studio.

        The console screen is used to show outputs and how the code works. It is also used to fix errors. You can open it by right clicking, then clicking inspect, and lastly clicking console on the tab that just opened up.
